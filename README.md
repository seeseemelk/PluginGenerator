# PluginGenerator
PluginGenerator is a small application that will ask you
three basic questions and will then generate a basic Bukkit plugin.

The three questions it asks are:
* What is the name of the plugin?
* What is the package name of the plugin?
* Do you want MockBukkit support?

It will then create a folder with the name of the plugin in your working directory
and put all the files inside of it.
